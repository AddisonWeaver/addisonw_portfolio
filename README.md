# Welcome to Addison's current portfolio!

This repository will currently hold all projects that I have completed and am working on. They include class projects, Mustang News data visualizations, personal projects, and more. Below you will find links to individual projects, updates, and descriptions of my work. 




## What's In A Name?
In this project, I created visualizations of the most common first names and last names based on Cal Poly's directory. I worked in R to create these visuals in AP format with some Mustang News colors. 

## Constructions Projects at Cal Poly In The Last Decade
In this project, I have collected all of the data from projects dating back to 2015, cleaning it, and then visualizing it in a format presentable to the Cal Poly and San Luis Obispo Community in R.
